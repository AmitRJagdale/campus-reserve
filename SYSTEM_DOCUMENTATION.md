## 1. System Overview & Problem Statement

### 1.1 Abstract & System Objectives
Higher education campuses and research facilities house high-value shared assets, including advanced robotics laboratories, computing clusters, seminar halls, and specialized diagnostic instruments. Historically, the scheduling of these facilities has relied on fragmented spreadsheets, paper logbooks, or siloed departmental communications. These manual approaches suffer from severe race conditions, scheduling conflicts, unauthorized access, and lack of real-time visibility.

**CampusReserve** addresses these challenges by providing an enterprise-grade reservation and resource governance engine. The platform guarantees:
1. **Mathematical Zero-Collision Scheduling:** Time-window interval overlap algorithms prevent double-booking at the database query level.
2. **Deterministic Role-Based Access Control:** Differentiated clearance rules allow automated instant booking for low-overhead equipment while enforcing faculty/administrative review for restricted facilities.
3. **Hard-Locked Administrative Security:** Self-registration is restricted strictly to students and faculty, locking the administrative tier to authorized personnel.
4. **Asynchronous Multi-Transport Notification:** High-fidelity HTML emails with cryptographic booking codes are dispatched to students and approvers over TLS/SSL SMTP.
5. **End-to-End Auditability:** Immutable audit ledgers record all booking creations, state mutations, digital check-ins, and communication dispatches.

---

### 1.2 Core Problems Solved

| Operational Challenge | Legacy Mechanism | CampusReserve Engineered Solution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Double-Bookings & Schedule Collisions** | Paper log sheets and uncoordinated calendars lead to concurrent conflicting sessions. | **Atomic Interval Algebra Guard:** SQL query enforces $(T_{\text{start}} < \text{Slot}_{\text{end}}) \land (T_{\text{end}} > \text{Slot}_{\text{start}})$ validation before record insertion, returning HTTP 409 on conflict. |
| **Clearance Bottlenecks** | Manual requisition forms require physical signatures across departments, causing 48–72h delays. | **Automated Policy Routing:** Resources flag `requires_approval`. Open hardware is auto-approved; restricted labs enter a dedicated real-time Approvals Desk for faculty/admin one-click action. |
| **Audit Opacity & No-Shows** | Lack of check-in verification leads to reserved rooms sitting idle while other researchers are locked out. | **Lifecycle State Tracking:** Bookings follow a strict state machine: `PENDING` $\to$ `APPROVED` $\to$ `CHECKED_IN` $\to$ `COMPLETED` (or `CANCELLED` / `REJECTED`) with digital check-in timestamps. |
| **Consecutive Booking Stalls** | Form resets in single-page apps clear date pickers or leave lingering locks, breaking second bookings. | **Reactive State Reset:** Clean lifecycle re-initialization restores date bounds, re-enables action buttons in `finally` blocks, and immediately re-queries slot matrices. |
| **Unauthorized Privilege Escalation** | Open registration endpoints allow arbitrary assignment of system administrative roles. | **Strict Admin Hard-Lock:** `POST /api/auth/register` blocks any attempt to create an `ADMIN` account with HTTP 403 Forbidden. |

### 2.1 Runtime & Framework Architecture
- **Runtime:** Node.js (v18.x / v20.x LTS) providing asynchronous, non-blocking I/O.
- **Server Framework:** Express.js configured with RESTful principles, JSON body parsing, CORS headers, and centralized error-handling middleware.
- **Modularity:** Layered routing architecture separating Authentication (`/routes/auth.js`), Resource Inventory (`/routes/resources.js`), Reservation Governance (`/routes/reservations.js`), and Infrastructure Telemetry (`/server.js`).

### 2.2 Relational Persistence Layer (SQLite3 Engine)
- **Relational Integrity:** Foreign key constraints enforced explicitly upon connection via `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;`.
- **Storage Profile:** Single-file storage (`campus_reserve.db`) offering ACID transactional guarantees, zero configuration latency, and instantaneous test isolation.

### 2.3 Cryptography, Session Storage & Strict Admin Hard-Lock
- **Password Hashing:** Passwords encrypted using `bcryptjs` with a work factor of 10 rounds ($2^{10} = 1024$ key expansion iterations).
- **Token Mechanism:** Stateless JSON Web Tokens (`jsonwebtoken`) signed with a 256-bit secret (`JWT_SECRET`) with a 24-hour expiration window.
- **Strict Admin Hard-Lock:** Self-registration is restricted strictly to `STUDENT` and `FACULTY`. Any registration payload requesting `ADMIN` is rejected with `HTTP 403 Forbidden`.
- **Remembered Accounts:** Secure client-side credential indexing in browser `localStorage` (`cr_saved_accounts`), rendering interactive avatar pills for one-click switching.

### 2.4 Transactional Notification Relay
- **Primary Engine:** Direct SMTP relay connecting to Google (`smtp.gmail.com`) over port 465 using SSL/TLS with strict App Password authentication.
- **Automated Fallback:** Initializes virtual test accounts via `nodemailer.createTestAccount()` if live credentials are absent.
- **Telemetry Logging:** Every transmission writes an immutable record to `email_logs`.

## 4. Business Logic & Mathematical Collision Avoidance

### 4.1 Interval Overlap Theorem & Formal Proof

Let a candidate reservation interval be defined as:
$$I_{\text{req}} = [T_{\text{start}}, T_{\text{end}})$$

Let an existing active reservation interval on the same resource and date be defined as:
$$I_{\text{exist}} = [\text{Slot}_{\text{start}}, \text{Slot}_{\text{end}})$$

#### Condition for Non-Overlap (Disjoint Intervals)
$$\text{Disjoint}(I_{\text{req}}, I_{\text{exist}}) \iff (T_{\text{end}} \le \text{Slot}_{\text{start}}) \lor (T_{\text{start}} \ge \text{Slot}_{\text{end}})$$

#### Condition for Collision (Overlapping Intervals)
$$\text{Collision}(I_{\text{req}}, I_{\text{exist}}) \iff (T_{\text{end}} > \text{Slot}_{\text{start}}) \land (T_{\text{start}} < \text{Slot}_{\text{end}})$$

---

### 4.2 SQL-Level Collision Guard
```sql
SELECT id, booking_code 
FROM reservations
WHERE resource_id = ?
  AND booking_date = ?
  AND status IN ('PENDING', 'APPROVED', 'CHECKED_IN')
  AND (start_time < ? AND end_time > ?);
```

---

### 4.3 Consecutive / Repeat Booking Lifecycle Fix
To eliminate consecutive booking failures:
1. The client state never resets `bookingDate` to empty string.
2. The submission button's loading state is managed inside a `finally` block, guaranteeing re-enablement regardless of success, conflict, or error.
3. Upon booking completion, `loadTimeSlots()` immediately refreshes the slot grid, dynamically updating the newly booked slot to "Reserved" while keeping remaining slots interactive.
